            <p id="tribute-info">Adeline Virginia Woolf (25 January 1882 – 28 March 1941) was an
                English writer, considered one of the most important modernist 20th-century authors and also a pioneer
                in
                the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device.

                Woolf was born into an affluent household in South Kensington, London, the seventh child in a blended
                family
                of eight which included the modernist painter Vanessa Bell. Her mother was Julia Prinsep Jackson and her
                father Leslie Stephen. While the boys in the family received college educations, the girls were
                home-schooled in English classics and Victorian literature. An important influence in Virginia Woolf's
                early
                life was the summer home the family used in St Ives, Cornwall, where she first saw the Godrevy
                Lighthouse,
                which was to become central in her novel To the Lighthouse (1927).

                Woolf's childhood came to an abrupt end in 1895 with the death of her mother and her first mental
                breakdown,
                followed two years later by the death of her half-sister and a mother figure to her, Stella Duckworth.
                From
                1897 to 1901, she attended the Ladies' Department of King's College London, where she studied classics
                and
                history and came into contact with early reformers of women's higher education and the women's rights
                movement. Other important influences were her Cambridge-educated brothers and unfettered access to her
                father's vast library.

                Encouraged by her father, Woolf began writing professionally in 1900. Her father's death in 1904 caused
                another mental breakdown for Woolf. Following his death, the Stephen family moved from Kensington to the
                more bohemian Bloomsbury, where they adopted a free-spirited lifestyle. It was in Bloomsbury where, in
                conjunction with the brothers' intellectual friends, they formed the artistic and literary Bloomsbury
                Group.

                In 1912, she married Leonard Woolf, and in 1917 the couple founded the Hogarth Press, which published
                much
                of her work. They rented a home in Sussex and moved there permanently in 1940. Throughout her life,
                Woolf
                was troubled by her mental illness. She was institutionalised several times and attempted suicide at
                least
                twice. Her illness may have been bipolar disorder, for which there was no effective intervention during
                her
                lifetime. In 1941, at age 59, Woolf died by drowning herself in the River Ouse at Lewes.

                During the interwar period, Woolf was an important part of London's literary and artistic society. In
                1915
                she published her first novel, The Voyage Out, through her half-brother's publishing house, Gerald
                Duckworth
                and Company. Her best-known works include the novels Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927) and
                Orlando (1928). She is also known for her essays, including A Room of One's Own (1929), in which she
                wrote
                the much-quoted dictum, "A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction."

                Woolf became one of the central subjects of the 1970s movement of feminist criticism and her works have
                since garnered much attention and widespread commentary for "inspiring feminism". Her works have been
                translated into more than 50 languages. A large body of literature is dedicated to her life and work,
                and
                she has been the subject of plays, novels and films. Woolf is commemorated today by statues, societies
                dedicated to her work and a building at the University of London.</p>

Let me sit here for ever with bare things, this coffee cup, this knife, this fork, things in themselves, myself being myself.”</blockquote>
